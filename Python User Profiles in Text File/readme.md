# Compare User Profile Names to Text File Data
UserProfilesInTextFile.py is a Python script that processes user profile folders from a network drive and compares them against a list of usernames stored in a text configuration file. The script generates two output files: one containing usernames found in the configuration file and another containing usernames not found in the configuration file.
