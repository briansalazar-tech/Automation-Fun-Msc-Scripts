GetUserProperties.ps1 script gets desired information from Get-ADUser -Properties *. 
I created the script to retreive only the information I found useful from the cmdlet.
Sometimes employees would change their names and their information would have to be updated manually in programs. 
However, those updates sometimes had to wait until certain properties were updated in AD.
